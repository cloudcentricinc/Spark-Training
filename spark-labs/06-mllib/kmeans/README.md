# KMeans Lab

In this lab we discuss how to use kmeans clustering in Spark.

## Step 1: Examine the MTCars dataset

Check out the dataset that we are going to cluster: MTCars. Those of you
with experience in R should remember this as one of R's internal datasets.

This dataset contains some statistics on 1974 Cars from Motor Trends

<img src="../../assets/images/6.1-cars2.png" style="border: 5px solid grey; max-width:100%;" />

You can also download and view the raw data in Excel : [cars.csv](../../data/mtcars/mtcars.csv)

Here are the columns:
* name   - name of the car
*  mpg   - Miles/(US) gallon                        
*  cyl   - Number of cylinders                      
*  disp  - Displacement (cu.in.)                    
*  hp    - Gross horsepower                         
*  drat  - Rear axle ratio            

Are there any natural clusters you can identify from this data?

We are going to use **MPG and CYL** attributes to cluster.


## Step 2: Inspect the script
Open file `kmeans_mtcars.scala` and examine it.  
This script has some *TODO* items in it.  
We are going to fix these TODO items and run the script **line-by-line** in Spark Shell to understand what is going on.

## Step 3 : Launch Spark Shell
```bash
    # go to the kmeans dir
    $  cd   ~/spark-labs

    # start shell
    $  ~/spark/bin/spark-shell
```

**=> Open the script `kmeans_mtcaras.scala` in a favorite editor.**  

**=> Copy paste snippets from text editor into Spark shell.  Watch the execution and the results**  

**==> And record the K vs.  WSSE values in the provided [excel sheet](WSSSE-versus-k.xlsx). **  

**=> Also keep an eye on Spark web UI (4040)**

## Step 4: Run the whole script

```bash
    # go to the kmeans dir
    $  cd   ~/spark-labs/06-mllib/kmeans  

    # supply the file to run with -i flag
    $ ~/spark/bin/spark-shell -i kmeans_mtcars.scala
```


## ---- [Optional] Following is Explanation ---


## Step 5 : Printing out the clusters
The following code prints out the clusters in a user-friendly way
```scala
model.transform(featureVector).show

```

The output may look like the following.  
Here we see **two clusters** (cluster 0 and cluster 1).  
**Compare the cars in each cluster,  Pay special attention to MPG (first attribute in vector) and CYLINDERS (second attribute).**

+-------------------+-----+---+----+-----+-----+---+---+----+----+----+---+--------------------+----------+
```



**=> Does the clustering make sense?  Perhaps we have too few clusters?**

## Step 6 : Run the whole script
**=> Exit spark shell, by pressing Ctrl+D**

**=> Run the spark shell in terminal as follows**

```
    $ ~/spark/bin/spark-shell -i kmeans_mtcars.scala
```

This will run the entire script in one go!


## Step 7 : Adjust the cluster number (K)
Edit file `kmeans_mtcars.scala`.   
**=> Change the `number of clusters` argument supplied to `Kmeans.train()` from `2` to `3`  function (around line # 60).**  

Run the script again
```
    $ ~/spark/bin/spark-shell -i kmeans_mtcars.scala
```

Inspect the output.   
Does clustering of cars make sense?
Try different values of `K` (4 or 5).

What is the WSSSE value when K = 32?  Can you explain? :-)

Make a note of the "wall clock time. " We will optimize this later.
This can be done by setting sc.setLogLevel("INFO") and measuring the time.

##Step 8: Optimize Script

Even though the dataset is tiny, notice that the datasets are running on disk without caching.  Could the cache() method help us at all?  

Edit file `kmeans_mtcars.scala`.  
Cache dataframe `featureVectors`
```scala
    featureVectors.cache
    featureVectors.count  // force caching
```

Then run again and note the wall clock time.
```
    $ time  ~/spark/bin/spark-shell -i kmeans_mtcars.scala
```


## Step 9: Record and Plot WSSSE versus K
Perform a plot of WSSSE versus K.  
Use the provided [excel sheet](WSSSE-versus-k.xlsx).   
Use the "elbow" method to pick what seems to be a good value of k.  
Does that match your intuitive sense of what is the best?

The excel sheet also have a sample plot we did.  
And here is the 'elbow curve'.   

<img src="../../assets/images/6.1-wssse-vs-k.png" style="border: 5px solid grey; max-width:100%;" />

## Step 10: Add some new data, check and see if it changes the clusters.
Edit input data file `../../../data/mtcars/mtcars.csv`.  
Add some new rows to the mtcars dataset based on your favorite cars (or just
make up some fictitious cars).

Then run the script again.
```
    $ time  ~/spark/bin/spark-shell -i kmeans_mtcars.scala  2> logs
```

See how adding this affects the way the data is clustered?


## BONUS: Automatically iterate across k.
Is there a way you could modify this to loop through values of K instead of
manually changing the values?  

## BONUS 2: Programmatically Perform Elbow Method

Using the principles of the "elbow" method, what is a way you could automatically
select a k value?
